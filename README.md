# Semeval-2023-Task1

This repository contains the scripts for the SemEval 2023 Task 1 on Visual Word Sense Disambiguation.
We propose several methods focusing on text augmentation, including prompting, WordNet definition matching, and text generation.
Different SOTA multi-modal image-text retrieval models are experimented, including CLIP, ALBEF, BLIP, and BLIP-2. 
We applied the [LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS) library developed by salesforce in our implementation.
We applied the [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps) API for text generation. An api key of openai is required in this method.
